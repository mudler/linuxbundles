# linuxbundles

Downloadable and runnable, standalone bundles of linux distributions built with Github actions:

- [x] Ubuntu 20.04
- [x] Alpine 3.15
- [x] ArchLinux
- [x] Gentoo
- [x] Debian Stretch
- [x] Fedora 36
- [x] openSUSE Leap 15.3
- [x] Ubuntu 20.04
- [x] Centos 8
- [x] Ubuntu LXDE

Download the bundle in the [release](https://github.com/mudler/linuxbundles/releases) page and just run them! (no root permission required).

By default, running the bundle will open up a shell which inherits env var from your system. To spawn up a clean shell, run:

```
./bundle - -c "env -i sh"
```

Built with [poco](https://github.com/mudler/poco)
